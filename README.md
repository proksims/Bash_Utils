# Simple Bash Utils

Development of Bash text utilities: cat, grep.
Bash utilities for working with C programming language texts. These utilities (cat and grep) are often used in the Linux terminal. As part of the project youâ€™ll learn the organization of the Bash utilities and solidify knowledge of structured programming.

## Part 1. Working with the cat utility

need to develop a cat utility:

- Support of all flags (including GNU versions) specified
- The source, header, and build files must be placed in the src/cat/ directory

| No. | Options                                                        | Description                                  |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | -b (GNU: --number-nonblank)                                    | numbers only non-empty lines                 |
| 2   | -e implies -v (GNU only: -E the same, but without implying -v) | but also display end-of-line characters as $ |
| 3   | -n (GNU: --number)                                             | number all output lines                      |
| 4   | -s (GNU: --squeeze-blank)                                      | squeeze multiple adjacent blank lines        |
| 5   | -t implies -v (GNU: -T the same, but without implying -v)      | but also display tabs as ^I                  |

## Part 2. Working with grep utility

need to develop the grep utility:

- Support of the following flags: `-e`, `-i`, `-v`, `-c`, `-l`, ` -n``-h `, `-s`, `-f`, `-o`
- The source, header and make files must be placed in the src/grep/ directory

| No. | Options | Description                                                    |
| --- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | -e      | pattern                                                        |
| 2   | -i      | Ignore uppercase vs. lowercase.                                |
| 3   | -v      | Invert match.                                                  |
| 4   | -c      | Output count of matching lines only.                           |
| 5   | -l      | Output matching files only.                                    |
| 6   | -n      | Precede each matching line with a line number.                 |
| 7   | -h      | Output matching lines without preceding them by file names.    |
| 8   | -s      | Suppress error messages about nonexistent or unreadable files. |
| 9   | -f file | Take regexes from a file.                                      |
| 10  | -o      | Output the matched parts of a matching line.                   |
